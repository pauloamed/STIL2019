The outputs of the experiments used for computing the accuracies reported on the paper.

Note: During the experiments phase, we noticied that the validation loss was wrongly multiplied by a positive constant. Therefore, it can be noticied a higher validation loss on some experiments.
It is critical to know that this mistake does **not** compromise our results. However, the loss reported on some of the outputs is thus not accurate.
